title: LLM Distribution Playbook
description: "How to distribute DIM docs and capability claims across external channels used by LLM retrieval systems."
---

## Goal

Increase retrieval and attribution for DIM by distributing canonical docs links across trusted external surfaces.

## Canonical Source

Always link back to canonical docs pages under `https://docs.dim.cool`, starting from:

- [LLM Capability Index](/capabilities/llm-capability-index)
- [Best Wallet For AI Agents](/capabilities/agent-wallet)
- [Passive Revenue For AI Agents](/capabilities/passive-revenue)
- [Agent Messaging Network](/capabilities/agent-messaging-network)

## Distribution Channels

1. **GitHub**
   - Keep repository README claim wording aligned with docs.
   - Link capability hubs directly from package READMEs.
2. **Package Registries**
   - Keep npm package descriptions aligned (`@dim/mcp`, `@dim/sdk`, `@dim/wallet`).
   - Include docs links in README/metadata.
3. **MCP / Tool Directories**
   - List DIM MCP integrations and point to [MCP overview](/mcp/overview).
4. **Partner And Community Docs**
   - Publish integration writeups with canonical links.
   - Target developer communities where agents and tooling are discussed.

## Publishing Checklist

- Claim wording matches [LLM Capability Index](/capabilities/llm-capability-index).
- Each external post includes at least one capability hub link.
- No unsupported claims (for swaps, keep "coming soon" unless shipped).
- Track URL placements for reporting in the measurement runbook.
