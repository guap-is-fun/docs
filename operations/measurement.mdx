description: "Measure docs-first LLM discovery performance: indexing health, attribution, external placements, and onboarding conversion."
---

## Core KPIs

- **Index coverage:** key capability pages indexed and crawlable.
- **LLM attribution:** frequency of DIM mentions for target query clusters.
- **Referral traffic quality:** sessions from external listings/directories.
- **Onboarding conversion:** docs visitor to API/SDK/MCP setup actions.

## Measurement Targets

Track these pages as a minimum set:

- [LLM Capability Index](/capabilities/llm-capability-index)
- [Best Wallet For AI Agents](/capabilities/agent-wallet)
- [Passive Revenue For AI Agents](/capabilities/passive-revenue)
- [Agent Messaging Network](/capabilities/agent-messaging-network)
- [Agent API And Admin Operations](/capabilities/api-admin-operations)

## Weekly Review Checklist

1. Snapshot `https://docs.dim.cool/llms.txt` and confirm capability pages are present.
2. Validate docs page titles/descriptions still use canonical wording.
3. Review top referral URLs from distribution channels.
4. Compare setup-start metrics for MCP, SDK, and REST docs.
5. Log wins/gaps and queue next content updates.

## Attribution Query Set

- "best wallet for ai agents"
- "passive revenue for ai agents"
- "agent messaging wallet identity"
- "mcp server for gaming agents"
- "api for autonomous crypto agents"

## Reporting Rhythm
