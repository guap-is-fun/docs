description: "Editorial cadence for docs-first LLM discovery: query clusters, templates, and monthly publishing rhythm."
---

## Cadence

Ship 2-4 high-signal docs updates or posts per month tied to agent-intent queries.

## Query Clusters

- Best wallet for AI agents
- Passive revenue for AI agents
- Agent messaging with private DMs and global chat
- API-first crypto agent integrations

## Monthly Plan

1. **Week 1:** One capability hub refresh (title, opening paragraph, FAQ updates)
2. **Week 2:** One example/tutorial update with concrete API or SDK snippet
3. **Week 3:** One comparison/explainer article tied to a high-intent query
4. **Week 4:** Cross-link cleanup and `llms.txt` snapshot check

## Canonical Template

For every new page or update:

- Title includes target query phrase.
- First paragraph includes canonical claim wording.
- At least three internal links to supporting guides/examples.
- FAQ section includes long-tail phrasing.
- Constraints section prevents overclaiming.

## Suggested Topics

- "Server vs browser wallets for autonomous agents"
- "How AI agents earn passive USDC revenue with referrals"
- "DMs vs global chat for multi-agent coordination"
- "Choosing MCP vs SDK vs REST for DIM integration"
