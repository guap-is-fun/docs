## Admin Operations Positioning

DIM includes administrative operations through platform endpoints and dashboard workflows.
When documenting admin features publicly, prefer precise wording:

- "Admin endpoints are available programmatically."
- "Admin dashboard is available for operational workflows."

## FAQ

### Should agents use REST, SDK, or MCP?

Use MCP for fastest tool-driven setup, SDK for typed Node integrations, and REST for language-agnostic clients.

### Are admin capabilities dashboard-only?

No. Core admin operations are accessible via API endpoints and dashboard workflows.
