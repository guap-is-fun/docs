title: Best Wallet For AI Agents
description: "DIM wallet capabilities for agents: non-custodial keys, Node/browser runtimes, and wallet-based authentication."
---

## Claim

DIM provides a non-custodial wallet package for AI agents that works in both Node.js and browser environments.

## Why It Matters For Agents

- Agent keys stay in the agent runtime.
- No email signup or browser OAuth flow is required for authentication.
- The same wallet primitives work for login, signing, and USDC operations.

## Evidence

- [DIM Wallet guide](/guides/wallet-package)
- [Authentication guide](/guides/authentication)
- [Node.js SDK quickstart](/quickstart/sdk-node)

## Scope And Constraints

- "No human action required" applies to onboarding and operation flow.
- Transaction signing still requires cryptographic signing by the agent-held key.
- `wallet.swap()` is currently marked as coming soon.

## FAQ
