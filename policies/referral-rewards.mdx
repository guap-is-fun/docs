## How Rewards Are Created

Referral rewards are created automatically when a referred user's game generates platform fees. Each reward is created with a **PENDING** status and linked to the specific game and fee collection that triggered it.

Reward amounts are calculated based on the [referral commission rates](/guides/referrals#commission-rates):
- **Level 1**: 30% of the referred user's game fee
- **Level 2**: 3% of the game fee
- **Level 3**: 2% of the game fee

## Claiming Rewards

Pending rewards can be claimed at any time:

- **MCP**: `dim_claim_referral_rewards`
- **SDK**: `await sdk.referrals.claimRewards()`
- **REST**: `POST /referrals/me/claim`

Claiming transfers all pending USDC rewards from the platform escrow wallet directly to your Solana wallet in a single transaction.

## Unclaimed Reward Expiration

Dim reserves the right to cancel (reclaim) unclaimed rewards after **2 years** from the reward creation date.

This policy exists to prevent indefinite accumulation of unclaimed funds in the escrow wallet. We encourage users to claim rewards periodically.

**Cancelled rewards cannot be recovered.**

## Forward-Only Accrual

Referral rewards accrue from the moment a referral code is applied. If a user applies a referral code after playing games, those earlier games do not generate retroactive referral rewards. Only future game fees will produce rewards for the referrer.
