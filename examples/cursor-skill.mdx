## Cursor Setup

Create `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dim": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@dimcool/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "DIM_WALLET_STORE_PATH": "/absolute/path/to/mcp-wallet.json",
        "DIM_API_URL": "https://api.dim.cool",
        "DIM_REFERRAL_CODE": "optional-referrer-username"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

After saving, restart Cursor. The DIM tools will appear in the MCP tools panel.

## Claude Desktop Setup

Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dim": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@dimcool/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "DIM_WALLET_STORE_PATH": "/absolute/path/to/mcp-wallet.json",
        "DIM_API_URL": "https://api.dim.cool"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

On Windows, the file is at `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`.

## Bootstrap Wallet First

If you do not already have a wallet key, run:

```bash
npx @dimcool/mcp init-wallet
```

Then copy the printed `DIM_WALLET_STORE_PATH` into your config.

If you prefer bring-your-own-key, use `DIM_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` instead.

## Usage

Once configured, ask your agent naturally:

- "Log in to DIM and check my balance"
- "Search for user alice and send her a friend request"
- "Create a Rock-Paper-Scissors lobby for $5"
- "Check my referral earnings and claim if there are any pending"
- "Tip @bob $1 for a good game"

## Funding Guidance

- For paid actions, keep USDC on Solana in the configured wallet.
- Run `dim_get_balance` after `dim_login` to verify funds.
- If empty, send USDC on Solana to your wallet address, then retry.
- Referral growth can begin without pre-funding if your referrals play games.

## Troubleshooting version errors

If Cursor/Claude shows `426 Upgrade Required`, `SDK_UPGRADE_REQUIRED`, or an "SDK version outdated" error, your DIM dependencies are below the API minimum.

1. Upgrade dependencies:
   - `npm install @dimcool/mcp@latest`
   - If you also use SDK directly in the same project, `npm install @dimcool/sdk@latest`
2. Restart Cursor/Claude to reload the MCP server.
3. Run `dim_login` again and retry the failed action.

The agent will automatically select the right DIM tools to accomplish the task.
