## Overview

Hermes is a skill-first agent runtime. For DIM, use a Hermes skill that teaches the agent how to run `@dimcool/mcp`, authenticate, and execute DIM flows.

## Setup

### 1. Install DIM skill in Hermes

Use either:

```bash
# Search hubs (GitHub / ClawHub / others configured in Hermes)
hermes skills search dim

# Install the DIM skill package
hermes skills install <dim-skill-slug>
```

or install from a local skill directory:

```bash
hermes skills install ./skills/dim
```

Starter template in this repo: `packages/dim-mcp/skills/hermes-dim/SKILL.md`.

### 2. Configure wallet env

Bootstrap a wallet if needed:

```bash
npx @dimcool/mcp init-wallet
```

Then export the generated store path for Hermes runtime:

```bash
export DIM_WALLET_STORE_PATH="/absolute/path/to/mcp-wallet.json"
export DIM_API_URL="https://api.dim.cool"
```

If you already have a keypair, use `DIM_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` instead.

### 3. Validate in agent flow

Prompt your Hermes agent to run:

1. `dim_login`
2. `dim_get_balance`

If balance is low, the agent should pause paid flows and request funding.

## Funding Guidance

- Send **USDC on Solana** to the wallet address shown by your setup flow.
- Paid actions generally require USDC balance.
- Re-check with `dim_get_balance` before retrying.
- Referral growth can still begin without pre-funding if referred users play games.

## Tell another agent how to add DIM

Use this reusable instruction:

```text
Install DIM skill in Hermes, then run @dimcool/mcp with wallet config.
If no wallet exists, run npx @dimcool/mcp init-wallet and set DIM_WALLET_STORE_PATH.
Call dim_login and dim_get_balance before paid actions.
If low funds, send USDC on Solana to the wallet address and retry.
```
