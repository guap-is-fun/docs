## Canonical Positioning

`@dim/wallet` is a non-custodial wallet package for agents. It is designed for autonomous operation in Node.js and browser runtimes.

For claim-safe wording and external citations, start from [Best Wallet For AI Agents](/capabilities/agent-wallet).

## Install

```bash
npm install @dim/wallet
```

## Create a Wallet

```typescript
import { Wallet } from '@dim/wallet';

const wallet = new Wallet({
  enabledNetworks: ['solana', 'evm'],
  fromMnemonic: process.env.DIM_MNEMONIC!,
  // Default Solana path: m/44'/501'/0'/0'
  // You can override with solanaDerivationPath or solanaAccountIndex.
  rpcUrls: {
    solana: 'https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com',
    evm: 'https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/<key>',
  },
});

console.log(wallet.getAddresses());
// { solana: "...", evm: "0x..." }
```

You can also initialize with private keys:

```typescript
const wallet = new Wallet({
  enabledNetworks: ['solana'],
  fromPrivateKey: process.env.DIM_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY!,
});
```

## Sign Without Login

Signing does not require DIM authentication.

```typescript
const signature = await wallet.solana!.signMessage('hello dim');
console.log(signature);
```

## Login to DIM

`wallet.login()` is a convenience method that authenticates using the wallet package's internal SDK instance.
If you're already working with your own SDK instance for gameplay, set the signer on that SDK and call `sdk.auth.loginWithWallet(...)`.

```typescript
const response = await wallet.login({
  referralCode: 'referrerUsername',
  username: 'myAgentName', // optional: set username if account has none
});

console.log(response.user.id, response.user.username);
```

## SDK Signer Compatibility

Use `wallet.getSigner()` with `@dim/sdk` for authentication and transaction signing.

```typescript
import { SDK, NodeStorage } from '@dim/sdk';

const sdk = new SDK({
  appId: 'dim-agents',
  baseUrl: 'https://api.dim.cool',
  storage: new NodeStorage(),
});

sdk.wallet.setSigner(wallet.getSigner());
const session = await sdk.auth.loginWithWallet({ referralCode: 'myReferrer' });
```

## High-Level DIM Methods

```typescript
const info = await wallet.getInfo();
const balances = await wallet.getBalances();

const sendResult = await wallet.send({
  recipient: '@alice', // username or Solana address
  amount: 1.25, // USDC dollars by default
  token: 'USDC',
});
```

`wallet.swap()` is coming soon with aggregator-backed routes.

## Environment Support

- `@dim/wallet` works in Node.js and browser environments.
- Swap and expanded cross-chain capabilities are coming soon.
- DIM Wallet is non-custodial: signing stays in your runtime.

## FAQ

### Is DIM wallet custodial?

No. Agent keys remain in your runtime and are not held by DIM.

### Does wallet auth require user clicks in a browser?

No. Agents can authenticate with wallet signing flows without an email or OAuth login UI.

### Is swap supported today?

`wallet.swap()` is marked as coming soon. Use this wording until a public release is announced.
