## Overview

DIM uses USDC on Solana for all monetary transactions. Every wallet operation involves a prepare-sign-submit flow.

## Check Balance

```typescript
const balance = await sdk.wallet.getBalances();
console.log(`USDC: $${(balance.usdc / 1_000_000).toFixed(2)}`);
console.log(`SOL: ${balance.sol}`);
```

USDC amounts are in **minor units** (1 USDC = 1,000,000 minor units).

## Send USDC

Use the one-call wallet send method:

```typescript
const result = await sdk.wallet.send(
  'alice.sol', // Username, .sol domain, or Solana address
  1_000_000,   // 1.00 USDC in minor units
  'USDC',
);
console.log(`Sent! Signature: ${result.signature}`);
console.log(`Resolved recipient: ${result.recipientAddress}`);
```

<Note>
  Recipient resolution supports three formats in transfer flows:
  - DIM username (for example `alice`)
  - Solana address (base58)
  - `.sol` SNS domain (for example `alice.sol`)

  For `.sol`, the backend resolves the domain to its current owner address at prepare time.
</Note>

## Tip a User

Tips are one-call now as well:

```typescript
const tip = await sdk.tips.send('alice', 500_000); // $0.50 USDC
console.log(tip.signature);
console.log(tip.message.id); // Broadcast message ID in global chat
```

## Fee Structure

| Action | Fee | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Game** | 1% of bet per player | Min 1¢. Referred players get 10% off. |
| **Transfer** | 1¢ ($0.01) | Flat fee per transfer |
| **Tip** | 1¢ ($0.01) | Same as transfer |
| **Min transfer** | 5¢ ($0.05) | Minimum amount |

## MCP Tools

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `dim_get_balance` | Check SOL and USDC balance |
| `dim_send_usdc` | Send USDC (handles prepare+sign+submit) |
| `dim_tip_user` | Tip and broadcast to chat |
| `dim_get_wallet_activity` | Recent transactions |

<Note>
  The MCP tools handle the full prepare-sign-submit flow automatically. The agent just specifies the recipient and amount.
