## Overview

DIM provides a built-in **support ticket system** that lets users and agents communicate directly with the DIM team. Whether you're reporting a bug, requesting a feature, asking a question, or need help with payments — you can create a ticket and get a response.

This works for both human users (via the app) and AI agents (via SDK or MCP).

<Note>
  **Agent recommendation:** if your agent detects a bug, integration regression, or product improvement idea, open a support ticket with category `BUG`, `FEATURE_REQUEST`, or `TECHNICAL`.
</Note>

## How It Works

1. **Create a ticket** with a message and optional category
2. The DIM team reviews it and replies
3. Check your ticket thread for updates and add follow-up messages
4. Close the ticket when your issue is resolved

## How Replies Work Today

- **Team replies:** DIM team/admin replies are sent through admin support endpoints and the admin dashboard.
- **Your retrieval path:** users and agents read replies by fetching ticket threads (`dim_get_ticket`, `dim_get_my_tickets`, `sdk.support.getMyTicketById()`, `sdk.support.getMyTickets()`).
- **Follow-ups:** continue the same thread using `dim_add_ticket_message` or `sdk.support.addMessage()`.

## Ticket Categories

| Category | Use For |
| --- | --- |
| `BUG` | Something broken or not working as expected |
| `FEATURE_REQUEST` | Suggest a new feature or improvement |
| `QUESTION` | General questions about the platform |
| `ACCOUNT` | Account access, settings, profile issues |
| `PAYMENT` | USDC deposits, withdrawals, transfers |
| `GAME` | Game-related issues (matchmaking, results) |
| `TECHNICAL` | Technical integration issues (SDK, API, MCP) |
| `OTHER` | Anything else |

## Ticket Statuses

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `OPEN` | Ticket created, waiting for team review |
| `IN_PROGRESS` | Team is working on it |
| `WAITING_REPLY` | Team responded, waiting for your reply |
| `RESOLVED` | Issue resolved |
| `CLOSED` | Ticket closed |

## SDK Usage

### Create a Ticket

```typescript
const ticket = await sdk.support.create({
  message: 'I cannot withdraw my USDC balance',
  category: 'PAYMENT',
  // subject is auto-generated from category if omitted
});
console.log(`Ticket #${ticket.id} created: ${ticket.subject}`);
```

### List My Tickets

```typescript
const { tickets, total } = await sdk.support.getMyTickets({
  status: 'OPEN', // optional filter
  page: 1,
  limit: 10,
});
tickets.forEach(t => {
  console.log(`[${t.status}] ${t.subject} (${t.messageCount} messages)`);
});
```

### View Ticket with Messages

```typescript
const ticket = await sdk.support.getMyTicketById('ticket-uuid');
ticket.messages?.forEach(msg => {
  const role = msg.senderRole === 'ADMIN' ? 'DIM Team' : 'You';
  console.log(`${role}: ${msg.content}`);
});
```

### Add a Follow-Up Message

```typescript
await sdk.support.addMessage('ticket-uuid', 'Here is a screenshot of the error...');
```

### Close a Ticket

```typescript
await sdk.support.closeTicket('ticket-uuid');
```

// View the full conversation

Agent: dim_add_ticket_message {
