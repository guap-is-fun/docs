## Overview

Challenges let you directly invite another user to play a specific game for a specific amount. The target receives a notification and can accept or decline.

## Create a Challenge

```typescript
const result = await sdk.challenges.create({
  gameType: 'rock-paper-scissors',
  amount: 5_000_000, // $5.00 USDC
  targetUsername: 'alice',
});
console.log(`Challenge sent: ${result.challengeId}`);
```

<ParamField path="amount" type="number" required>
  Challenge amount in USDC minor units. Must be between $1 and $1,000.
</ParamField>

You can target by `targetUsername` or `targetUserId`.

## Accept a Challenge

```typescript
const result = await sdk.challenges.accept(challengeId);
console.log(`Lobby: ${result.lobbyId}, Game: ${result.gameId}`);
```

When accepted, a lobby is automatically created with both players and the challenge amount as the bet.

## Decline a Challenge

```typescript
await sdk.challenges.decline(challengeId);
```
